                      To analyse requirements of the Nathan App, we followed
                      modern standard user research methods. We Conducted
                      brainstorming sessions with clients and as a team to show
                      them existing products in line with their market to get their
                      feedback.

                    guidelines.
                    While doing our research, we started exploring the
                    possibilities in layouts and options to provide the desired
                    experience. We studied their competitors’ approaches,
                    similar features in their market, checked up latest UI/UX
                    trends, to establish a good UX guidelines.

                    We finally got to define the layout and flow of the required
                    interface, we created mockups to great-looking images
                    with theme and styles applied to them.
                    We prepared and shared the design specifications
                    (principles, guidelines, colors, typography, iconography) to

                  The Development Team built back end functionality first
                  and connects it with UI. The Implementation of back-end
                  functionality and front interface started with complete
                  functionality and experience.

                    Understanding who our project audience was very crucial,

                    designed but could have so many different meanings, and

                    The scale of our work dictates what the combination of icon
