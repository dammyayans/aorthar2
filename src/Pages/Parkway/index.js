                  Parkway Limited approached us to assist with the creation
                  of an entirely new identity. The client was in the midst of
                  upgrading its corporate branding to better showcase its
                  values, accomplishments and class. Our remit was to create
                  a total branding package that was both simple and
                  sophisticated.

                  paraphernalia and other items that constitute its entire

                  Considering the precedent of the client, our approach was
                  to take the qualities Parkway Limited was best known for
                  and infuse these into an identity that is both recognizable
                  and evocative. We intended to put the heart into Parkway’s
                  identity and we knew exactly where to start.

                  The new logo and colour scheme we developed for Parkway
                  Limited had two main colours, orange and black. Orange is
                  a colour that is associated with the soil. Apart from being a
                  builder’s colour, it showcases enthusiasm, determination,
                  creativity, encouragement and success, all attributes that
                  showcased our client’s identity.
